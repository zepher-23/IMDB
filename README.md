NOTE: 
1. I have used bootstrap js only for toast messages to be notified when the user adds or remove movie from favorite list.
2. I have used local storage in the browser to store the favorite list, so that it remains unchanged even if the browser is closed.
3. All pages have independent js files linked.
4. A dummy poster image has been used wherever the movie poster is not available, this image is stored in `img` folder.
